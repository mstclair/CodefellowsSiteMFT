	<p>
		I was born and raised for the most part in the Renton area in Washington State. My background is a bit varied. I spent four
		years in the United States Air Force where I was a nuclear missile maintenance technician. After the service, I went to graduate
		school for counseling and psychology. I graduated in 2015 and have been having trouble finding useful resources for the test, which is why I built one!
		After grad school I began a computer application development program in order to better understand the world I live in. I am very interested in a web design/development
		career. It is my hope to gain skills in my classes and go to a web dev coding camp this summer and have a job by the fall/winter.
